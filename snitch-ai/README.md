# Getting Started with SNITCH:AI
This is a breakdown of each of our react components as well as some additional commands that can be ran on local. See below for the previously mentioned commands. 

# SNITCH:AI Components

## Account Home
This is the home page for the current user. This component allows the user to update their account credentials and to create a custom AI detection model if the account is a professor account. 

## Authentication Form
This is where all of the account creation and login code paths are housed. Everything is authenticated to Firebase. Which is what we use for hosting SNITCH:AI and as a real-time database for storing user account information.

## History
This is where the full report on whether or not an assignment was AI generated or not can be found. History holds all of the past submissions that a professor has uploaded so they can see which assignments were AI generated in the past. This page also allows the user to verify whether or not a work was actually AI generated, which will then be used to train SNITCH:AI's custom model. 

## Prompt Form 
This is where the professor can upload student's assignments or a prompt that they predict that a student used to generate AI work. If the professor thinks that they know what prompt the student used, they can simply input the question that was being asked to the student on the assignment and then input the suspected prompt. This will return a raw response from the integrated AI models (ChatGPT/Gemini). 

## Theme/Light and Dark mode
This is a simple component that allows the users (regardless of role) to change the theme from light mode to dark mode based on their preference. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
