# AI-Detector (name work in progress)
This repository is dedicated to the **(name of project)** capstone project for the Spring 2024 graduating class at Southwestern University.

# Uses (anticipated)
This tool is meant to be useful in detecting the use of AI on homework/project submissions. If you are a student, you will be able to view how much your work matches the output of different AI models. To avoid the temptation of using any AI generated work, the student view is limited to only being able to see a match percentage. For admins (most likely teachers or professors), a different view will be available, where AI generated output will be avaialable to see and compare to the submission (for different AI models).
