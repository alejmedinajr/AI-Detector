The sequence comparison compares string using difflib sequence matcher. This is an extension of 
gestalt pattern matching which finds the longest contiguous matching subsequence that is applied to
pieces of the sequence on the left and right of the matching subsequence. The extension of this 
sequence matcher is the removal of whitespace and blank lines in the strings before they are turned 
into sequences.
